# maturin is self bootstraping, however on platforms like alpine linux that aren't
# manylinux, pip will try installing maturin from the source distribution.
# That source distribution obviously can't depend on maturin, so we're using
# the always available setuptools.
#
# Note that this is really only a workaround for bootstrapping and not suited
# for general purpose packaging, i.e. only building a wheel (as in
# `python setup.py bdist_wheel`) and installing (as in
# `pip install <source dir>` are supported. For creating a source distribution
# for maturin itself use `maturin sdist`.
